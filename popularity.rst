Available sources disagree on the actual number of installations.  [liedtke93]_
mentions 2000 systems were installed by 1985, but [gmdbericht86a]_ counts
only 1000 systems by the end of 1986. Amongst the users were a growing number
of schools: 20 in 1982 ([alwr82]_, part 4, p. 13) and 500 secondary schools by
1986 [computerwoche86b]_. A few of them are known by name: Helmholtz-Gymnasium
Bonn [computerwoche79b]_ [gmdspiegel84b]_, Rhein-Sieg-Gymnasium located in
Sankt Augustin [gmdbericht82]_ and Max-Planck-Gymnasium Bielefeld. EUMEL was
also by HRZ Bielefeld and at GMD Bonn, as well as TU Berlin [hahn79]_ and TU
Darmstadt.

A survey amongst lawyers from Hannover in 1994 revealed four of 56 (7%) law
offices still ran EUMEL machines eight years after intruduction of ErgoJUR and

By mid 1985 support for the Japanese *Kanji* writing system was added to EUMEL
[gmdspiegel85d]_. A newly founded corporation *NISSIN Products Corp. Tokyo*
sold the product on the Japanese market [gmdbericht85]_.
